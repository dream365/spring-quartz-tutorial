/*
The API provides a Job interface having just one method â€“ execute.
It must be implemented by the class that contains the actual work to be done, i.e. the task.
When a job's trigger fires, the scheduler invokes the execute method, passing it a JobExecutionContext object.

The JobExecutionContext provides the job instance with information about its runtime environment,
including a handle to the scheduler, a handle to the trigger, and the job's JobDetail object.
